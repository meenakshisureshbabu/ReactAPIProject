## About the Project

The main purpose of this project is to publish a website about fruits nutrition values and its importance of comsuming them.
Users can go through the website and can gain knowledge about the different fruits. Also one can see our nearest grocery stores in a single click on the menu.

### Motivation

When I am looking through the websites searching for the fruits nutrients, I was being redirected to multiple pages to know about them.
That motivated me to do a simple website like this , where the user can just hop-in and see the nutrients of all the fruits in few clicks.
